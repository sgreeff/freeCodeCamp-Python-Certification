# 🐍 Python Scientific Computing Certification
### freeCodeCamp.org | Professional Development Portfolio

This repository tracks my journey through the 461-step **Scientific Computing with Python** certification. My goal is to master the programmatic foundations required to lead **NZ Scholarship Digital Technologies** students.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* **Foundational Logic:** Progressing from basic syntax to complex loops and sequences.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Building scalable applications using Classes and Inheritance (key for Scholarship-level projects).
* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Implementing classic algorithms like the Tower of Hanoi and Hash Tables.

## 🏆 Certification Projects
These projects represent the culmination of each module and demonstrate independent problem-solving:
- [ ] **Arithmetic Formatter**
- [ ] **Time Calculator**
- [ ] **Budget App**
- [ ] **Polygon Area Calculator**
- [ ] **Probability Calculator**

## 🗓️ Progress Log
- **Start Date:** December 2025
- **Current Status:** 14 / 461 Steps Complete (Introduction to Python)
- **Key Reflection:** Transitioning from PHP/SQL logic to Pythonic naming conventions and scope handling.
